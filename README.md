## ASEC Data Wrangling process
1. Filter dataset for males 18+ years of age
2. Categorize marital status categories as either married or single:
    - Codes 1-4 are categorized as married
    - Codes 5-7 are categorized as single
4. Convert hispanic codes into Yes/No flags
5. Clean race types (White, Black, Asian, or Other):
    - Codes 01, 06, 07, 08 and 09 are flagged as White
    - Codes 2, 10, 11, and 12 are flagged as Black
    - Codes 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, and 15 are flagged as Asian
    - All remaining codes are flagged as Other
6. Convert income codes into income values
    - Every other code is paired together (ex., 3 & 4, 5 & 6, etc.) with the maximum income for the lesser code (ex., both codes 3 & 4 are indicated as $7,499, both codes 5 & 6 are indicated as $12,499, etc.)

# Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
This dataset includes data on adult's diet, physical activity, and weight status from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Obesity Data Wrangling Process
1. Filter dataset for year starting 2020, US location
2. Filter questions for "Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity"
3. Filter dataset for the male gender
4. Index the remaining Data_Value variable for percentage obesity (31.7%)
